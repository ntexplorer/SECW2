## 6. Things that we need to include in the quiz:

### Unit 1: Tian
* The COMSC engagement team need the ability to add new questions.

* This should include question ID, question type, the question itself.

* It needs to include the correct answer plus addtional incorrect answers. 

* It should include difficulty level and category of question.

* Make sure the question is stored in a database

### Unit 2: Rory
* The COMSC engagement team need the ability to amend or delete current questions.

* Similar to Unit 1 they should be able to amend the question itself, correct answer plus additional incorrect answers and difficulty level

* Make sure the amended question is stored in a database & make sure it has a different question ID. 

### Unit 3: Ryann
* COMSC team should be able to create the 2 quiz’s (multiple choice and true/false)

* They should decide on the number of questions to be included in the quiz, the level of difficulty and category and also set the timer (i.e. aet how long the pupils get to answer the question). 

### Unit 4: Elaine
* Enable pupil to take part in a quiz
 
* Initially the pupil selects the type of quiz i.e. multiple choice or true/false

* The system then randomly picks the questions from the database. 

### Unit 5: Ellie
* The pupil starts the quiz.

* The pupil gets feedback about whether their answer is correct directly after answering the question. 

* Pupil needs to be told what correct answer is if it is incorrect. 

* The pupil has an option to skip the question (this is treated as an incorrect answer) 

* Pupil has an option to end the quiz early/restart quiz. 

* At the end of the quiz the pupil’s overall score is displayed. 

### Unit 6: Robert
* The COMSC engagement team are able to view statistics about visitors overall performance on the quiz. (For example; percentage of time a question is answered correctly, the question most often answered incorrectly, and percentage of people who gave up at that question.)

* The COMSC team need to be able to access this info from the COMSC user interface. 

### Unit 7
* COMSC team need to be able to log in.

## 7. These are examples of additional things that we can include:

* Questions are displayed in a random order
* The Engagement team can select a particular topic for the quiz
* The Engagement team can enter information about the schools attending an event
* The Engagement team can download statistics for a particular event or school.
* COMSC team should be able to delete a question.
