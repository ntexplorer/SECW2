# Unit 2

* The COMSC engagement team need the ability to amend or delete current questions.

* Similar to Unit 1 they should be able to amend the question itself, correct answer plus additional incorrect answers and difficulty level

* Make sure the amended question is stored in a database & make sure it has a different question ID.
